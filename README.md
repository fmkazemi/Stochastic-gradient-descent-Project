Stochastic gradient descent project to fit the parameters Θ for the training data A2_T1.tab (a tab-delimited text file) posted here. This data consists of 2 features
and 500 instances. For this task, we want to answer the following questions:

a) SGD implementation source code

b) A pseudo-code description of your implementation

c) A plot showing the value of the least-squares cost function J(Θ) every 10 epochs. In the plot, the y-axis are the values of J(Θ) and in the x-axis are the
number of epochs done by SGD

d) The final values you found for the parameters Θ
